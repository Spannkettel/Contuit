# Contuit

Contuit is a simple website hosted on GitHub Pages.
These pages are a place for me to experiment, and do
some coding with an AI. Also to share a few simple
blog posts about AI etc.

## Features

- Responsive design maybe?
- Easy to navigate - not so much.
- Lightweight and fast I guess?
- Not hosted by a megacorp.
- Not template designed or constrained. 

## Usage

Navigate to `https://spannkettel.github.io/Contuit` to view the website.

## AI

- working on coding with a lot of help from GPT 4o

## Editing

For now, I think I'd like to just putter at it.
Open to suggestions.

Cheers. Spannkettel.
